# SmartBrain
Face detection in the web, simply create an account, login, post a url to an image, and see the magic happen.

# Why
Built simply so I can learn and understand somewhat deeply how react works, also everyone is hyping up golang so I decided I'll give it a try.

This project's Backend runs on Golang server, Postgresql for the DB, and Python for face detection (openCV) and is currently a private repo becaues it is self hosted on and old laptop of mine ( the code currently contains the encryption key to generate JWT tokens, instead of reading it from an ENV variable).
